# British-Informatics-Olympiad

Very readable, relatively easy-to-understand solutions for the British Informatics Olympiad.
While most of these solutions are done without any help, a few of these files are modified versions of other people's code. Check out **Matthewelse** and **Spookiel**.

Please don't hesitate to send any improvements, though I will only make these changes as long as the code remains readable.

Disclaimer: These are by no means official solutions and are written solely in Python. Not all solutions are complete or give full marks, but the most recent years should be more complete.

These things said, I hope these are helpful to programmers practicing for this and similar competitions.

**Tips:**
<list>
  1. (Optional) Get Pycharm! I used to use the standard IDLE, but Pycharm has helped me improve my efficiency significantly, especially for longer pieces of code.
  2. Learn the basics - Python syntax (or you might use another language), recursion, BFS, DFS and memoization are all pretty much essential for the BIO. The BIO doesn't really stretch far beyond these concepts, though. If you want more diverse problems, I recommend CSES and Codeforces. If you want more maths, go for Project Euler!
  3. Try the problems first on your own, whether it takes 10 minutes, an hour or 3 hours! The problems from earlier years are definitely easier, so perhaps start with those.
  4. Once you have, find how you scored. Did you end up with a logical error? Or did you get a TLE? Or was it perfect?
  5. Whatever your outcome, check these solutions; the comments and the variable names should help you get a better understanding of the problem. 
  6. When testing, being able to input multiple test cases is often handy. I don't recommend going as far as unit testing, but try using a while loop.
  7. Then leave it for a while and try doing the problem on your own again!
  8. I sometimes add comments in the extra description, so do check them out. (You can access this when you are looking at a solution by pressing the ... next to the description at the top).
